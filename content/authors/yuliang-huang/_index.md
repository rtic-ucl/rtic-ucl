I am a PhD student in the RTIC group. I am funded by EPSRC and our industrial collaborator Elekta, working on respiration motion modelling with CBCT images for lung cancer patients. I am keen to research general deep learning and optimization techniques, as well as their application in more specific domains such as image registration/reconstruction, automatic treatment planning and adaptation of radiotherapy, etc.
