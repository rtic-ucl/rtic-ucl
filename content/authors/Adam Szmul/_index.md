Adam Szmul is a Senior Research Fellow at Radiotherapy Image Computing Group within the UCL Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences. Adam completed his DPhil at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering at the University of Oxford, where he worked on novel methods for multi-modal lung image registration for CT, MRI and hyperpolarised Xenon-MRI, and CT-based ventilation estimation methods. While at UCL, Adam worked on developing an automatic framework for identifying and segmenting different classes of parenchymal lung damage. Recently, he worked on AI-methods for image synthesis for paediatric abdomen patients using unsupervised machine learning techniques. Adam coordinated RTICâ€™s appearances at Science of Surgery and at Bloomsbury Festival. Adam is also engaging with policy makers by presenting his research at the House of Parliament and in Multi-agency advisory service for AI and digital technologies. Adam was previously awarded CMIC Platform Grant and UCL-PKU Strategic Partner Grant by UCL Global Engagement.
