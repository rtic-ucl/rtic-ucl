I am a first-year PhD student in the Radiotherapy Image Computing Group (RTIC) group at the Centre for Medical Image Computing (CMIC) at UCL. My research is also conducted in collaboration with Leo Cancer Care Ltd. My work focuses on developing machine learning- and computer vision-based methods to determine the benefits of upright radiotherapy.
