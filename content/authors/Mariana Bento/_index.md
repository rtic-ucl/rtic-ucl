My name is Mariana, I'm 25 years old, and I come from a small town in Portugal by the coast.

In 2019, I took part in a summer internship in the Medical Physics and Biomedical Engineering department at UCL to work on the study of NTCP (normal tissue complication probability) models for paediatric patients undergoing radiotherapy treatments.

In 2020, I started my PhD project regarding the development of 3D printed phantoms for quality assurance applications in paediatruc radiotherapy, for which I'm currently investigating thermoplastics in terms of radiological equivalency with biological tissues.
