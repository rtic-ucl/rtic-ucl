Respiratory motion can cause errors and uncertainties when planning and delivery radiotherapy treatments to targets in the thorax and abdomen.

At RTIC we are developing models of respiratory motion which include breath-to-breath variability, methods of fitting these models to a variety of imaging data including (unsorted) 4DCT, multi-slice MRI, and CBCT projection data, and tools for using these models to improve future radiotherapy treatments.
