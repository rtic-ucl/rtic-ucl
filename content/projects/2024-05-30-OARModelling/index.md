One key step of radiotherapy treatment planning is contouring the OARs. Historically, clinicians have manually delineated these contours. Studies have shown significant differences in contours among various clinicians (inter-observer variability). Recently, AI solutions have offered a promising alternative to the traditional manual delineation approach. These allow for significant time savings while producing more homogenous delineations.
 
This project aims to model the variability of OAR contours in a population. This information will enable us to make predictions about whether a new contour lies within the clinically accepted variability or needs to be corrected. We will also be able to compare the variability between different populations of patients.
