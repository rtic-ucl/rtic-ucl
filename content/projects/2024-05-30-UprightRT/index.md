This project revisits the concept of upright radiotherapy and uses modern technology to determine the benefits and challenges of upright radiotherapy.
Upright radiotherapy allows for gantry-free treatment, significantly reducing the cost and size of machines. However, in many areas, the effects of positioning the patient in an upright are still yet to be determined, a few of these factors include stability, patient positioning reproducibility, and anatomical changes due to changes in the direction of gravity.
This project aims to leverage various computer vision and machine learning techniques to determine the benefits of testing patients upright.
