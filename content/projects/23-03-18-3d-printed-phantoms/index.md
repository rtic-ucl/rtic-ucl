This project focuses on the development of 3D-Printed phantoms for quality assurance in paediatric radiotherapy. 

<!--more-->

*[this description is an example]*

By using 3D-printing technology, this project aims to create anatomically accurate phantoms that can be used to assess the accuracy and performance of radiotherapy treatment plans in children. The 3D-printed phantoms will be designed to mimic the size and shape of a child's body and will be equipped with embedded radiation dosimeters to measure the radiation dose. The use of these phantoms will provide a more accurate method for testing radiotherapy technology and will help ensure a higher standard of care for young patients.
