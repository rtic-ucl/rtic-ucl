Modelling intra- and inter-fractional anatomical changes for planning, guiding, and monitoring radiotherapy treatment of lung and H&N patients 

<!--more-->

*[this description is an example]*

This project focuses on developing new techniques to improve the accuracy of radiotherapy treatment for patients with lung and head and neck (H&N) cancers. By combining advanced imaging technology and sophisticated computer modeling, we are able to track anatomical changes between and within fractions of radiotherapy treatments, taking account changes from weight loss between treatments to breathing and disgestive motions during administration of radiotherapy. This allows us to accurately plan, guide, and monitor a patient's treatment throughout the duration of their therapy, improving the accuracy and effectiveness of the treatment. Our research is paving the way for more precise and personalized cancer treatment, and we are committed to continuing to develop new and innovative methods for making radiotherapy more effective for our patients.
