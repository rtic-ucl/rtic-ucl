In the last few months, the RTIC group participated in two outreach events. The first one, the Widening Access to Medical Sciences Taster Day, happened back in December. Our group and colleagues from WEISS met to present engaging activities to sixth-form students interested in studying medicine-related degrees.

The second event was Science of Surgery, an open-house event at Charles Bell House in April. This allowed us to engage with diverse audiences, from young children to elderly members of the community. Our radiotherapy game particularly attracted the younger generations and allowed us to describe in a few words what cancer and radiotherapy were. With interested audiences, we shared a more detailed discussion of how a radiotherapy treatment is planned, and where our research fits into the various steps.
