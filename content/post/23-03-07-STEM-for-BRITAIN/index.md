We were delighted to once again have our research represented at the prestigious STEM for BRITAIN event which took place on Monday 6th March 2023 at the House of Commons.

PhD Candidate, Poppy Nikou, was shortlisted from hundreds of applicants including early-career research scientists, engineers, technologists, and mathematicians, to appear in Parliament where she presented her research ‘Modelling Anatomical Changes during Radiotherapy Treatment’ to politicians and expert judges.

Poppy commented: “It was a pleasure to present my work to policy makers and industrial representatives at the house of commons. I greatly appreciated the opportunity to discuss how medical imaging and computational models can result in improvements in planning and delivery of radiotherapy treatment.

The presentations really highlighted the breadth and depth of the STEM field within the UK. This celebration of research was very complementary to the announcement of the new science and technology framework made by the government on the day. As an early career researcher, it was really exciting to hear the news from the chair of the science and technology select committee and important to have them support our work.”

## STEM for BRITAIN
STEM for BRITAIN is a poster competition which takes place in the House of Commons annually involving approximately 120 early stage or early career researchers and is judged by professional and academic experts.  All presenters are entered into either the engineering, the biological and biomedical sciences, the physical sciences (chemistry), the physical sciences (physics) session, or the mathematics session, depending on the researcher’s specialism. 

The competition is open to early stage or early career researchers, which includes university research students, postgraduates, research assistants, postdocs, research fellows, newly-appointed lecturers, part-time and mature students, returners, those people embarking on a second career, and their equivalent in national, public sector and industrial laboratories, and appropriate final year undergraduate and MSc students, all of whom are engaged in scientific, engineering, technological or medical research.
