We were delighted to have attended the International Symposium in Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) in Cartagena, Colombia for the first time. The conference included an industrial day as well as a clinical day, piecing together how the research presented could be translated into practice.

Jamie McClelland co-organised a special session on “How image computing can make a real impact in the radiotherapy workflow”, alongside colleagues from the radiotherapy research group at the Christie Hospital, Manchester. The session was followed by a great discussion on where the key areas for future development are within the field. 


Jamie also gave a talk at the ML for health workshop, which was hosted by the University of Antioquia before the conference. The talk was titled “Opportunities, challenges and pitfalls for AI in radiotherapy”. The workshop sparked great questions, discussions and helped create potential new collaborations with the university in Medellin. 


At the ISBI conference, Yuliang Huang presented his work on “Surrogate-drive motion model for motion compensated cone-beam CT reconstruction using unsorted projection data” on the final day of the conference. Alkisti Stavropoulou presented her work at a poster session on “Automating image analysis pipelines for large scale studies of radiation induced lung damage” at a poster session. Poppy Nikou also presented her work at a poster session on “Modelling anatomical changes during radiotherapy treatment” at a poster session. These presentations were a great opportunity to discuss ideas, gain valuable suggestions and showcase our research to the wider medical imaging computing community. 


Overall, the conference was a great experience. There were a number of good, thought provoking key note speakers and interesting technical work presented in the oral and poster presentations. It allowed for networking opportunities with new research groups, as well as enforce existing collaborations with groups in the field. And of course – Colombia was amazing!
